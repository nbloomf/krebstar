Introduction
------------

This is the user manual, design documentation, and source code of the `krebedit` text editor. As of this writing the project is very much Not Ready for Prime Time, as it supports exactly zero users. It is under rapid development though, and I hope for it to be "self-hosting" -- featureful enough that I can develop krebedit _in_ krebedit -- very soon.
