<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>The first-order objective of this project is <strong>to build a plain text editor</strong>. This tool should be suitable for technical work, extensible, and enjoyable to use. I will consider this goal achieved when the editor is practical enough to be used as my daily driver. It would be a nice bonus if the project gains more than one user but I don’t expect this to ever happen.</p>
<p>The second-order objective of this project is <strong>to learn how to build a mid-sized project</strong>. I’ve built some small tools and libraries but now it’s time to level up, and building an editor is a decent way to get there because it touches so many fundamental problems.</p>
<p>The third-order objective of this project is <strong>to document the design and implementation of a mid-sized project</strong>. To this end I’m using a semi-literate programming style where the code and documentation are intertwined. I’m also trying to minimize the number of third party dependencies, opting to rewrite functionality that a real project would probably import from a library.</p>
