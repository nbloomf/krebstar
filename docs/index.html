<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This text is the user manual, design documentation, and source code of the <code>krebedit</code> text editor. As of this writing the project is very much Not Ready for Prime Time, as it supports exactly zero users. It is under rapid development though, and I hope for it to be “self-hosting” – featureful enough that I can develop krebedit <em>in</em> krebedit – very soon.</p>
<p>In lieu of practically usable software, and to give a taste of the plans for the project, here is a very rough overview of the components and their goals.</p>
<ul>
<li>At the base is a <em>minimal core</em> supporting the essential functions of an editor: modeling and manipulating text buffers. This component is minimally concerned with user input, display, and file IO, and the API it exposes should be as compact and orthogonal as possible.</li>
<li>Facing the user we have one or more <em>frontends</em> for interacting with the core. A terminal interface is the simplest (and currently only) one of these, but the design is meant to allow, for instance, a native GUI or web-based frontend.</li>
<li>For extensibility we have a built-in <em>command language</em> that can also drive the core. This language is statically typed and concatenative, and designed as a separate component suitable for inclusion in other projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even at this early stage the core of each of these pieces is mostly in place. But it turns out that the hard part of building a text editor is not the core components – drawing to the screen, editing buffers – but rather the dozens or hundreds of policy level decisions about API design. It is very important to me that interfaces be thoughtful and, to the extent possible, <em>natural</em>; achieving this is a fun puzzle.</p>
<p>Of course the main goal of this project is to produce a text editor I can use in my daily work, and I’ll mainly judge my success on this metric. (I write and edit a <em>lot</em> of text.) But I have some auxilliary goals as well.</p>
